    		The Problem
       	  </h3>
          <p class="content-text">
          	Our application has a lot going on, and it can be hard to navigate without knowing what you're doing. This isn't a layperson application; it's a business tool for physicians. As such, the company has an implementations team that attempts to train first time users when they purchase our license. The issue is that many more users will end up using our app than those who were there at that training. 
		  </p>
          <p class="content-text">
          	To accomodate this, our application has a series of tutorial slides that appear when a user logs in for the first time. These images are meant to explain how to use the application with text and screenshots. Long story short, they failed to do their job. 
		  </p>
          <p class="content-text">
          	Our company was spending too much on training for first time users, and our current tutorials didn't seem to help. In fact, they generated more customer requests to be able to skip them, which was functionality we did not offer. All in all, they did more harm then good, but rather than get rid of them, we wanted to fix them.

    		Discovery
       	  </h3>
          <p class="content-text">
          	I began by researching best practices for mobile application onboarding. Mobile onboarding has been around in many forms for a long time, and as such there is a lot of research out there already. Because of this, and taking into account our team's resources, there wasn't a need to conduct our own research process for this project when there were enough studies out there. 
          </p>
          <p class="content-text">
            I learned a lot in my research, including what type of information should be included, the number of slides, good design approaches, how many words, and that tutorial slides are not a good solution to onboarding. At that point, I had to weigh the options - should I design a better version of a suboptimal solution or design a completely revamped onboarding process? But based on both the timeline I was given and the limited dev resources given to this initiative, the sliding images was the smartest option.

            <div class="content-content">
             <img src="img/IM_Tutorial1.GIF" alt="img01" class="img-responsive" style="width:50%"/>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p class="content-text">
          	I focused on four main things in my deisgn: 
          </p>
          <ul>
          	<li>Updated Design</li>
          	<li>More Relevant Content</li>
          	<li>Better Context</li>
          	<li>Better Interactivity</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="content-text">
          	My first target was locking down what content was to be included, ulitlizing the research I had done to add, subtract, and modify the current content. Part of the research I did actually distinguished between tutorial screens and app store screenshots. They provide similar yet different information to very different users - the former is for users who have committed to using our application, and the latter is for people who are searching for our application. Because of this, I decided to account for both of these in this project. 
          </p>
		  <p class="content-text">
          After that, I started messing with the UI. This gives me a more visual starting point for the interaction design afterwards. With an initual UI update created, I started brainstorming ways to improve the context - how to get the users to draw a line between the words on the screen and the screenshot below. I went through multiple iterations of this design, even bringing a potential winner in front of a group of executives who were interested in the outcome, but all those options fell below the mark. This caused me to think outside the box, deciding to give animation at try. This solution appeared to solve the issue, as I could directly point to the relevent aspects of the UI for the action I was describing, as well as show the user the outcome of that action. 
          </p>
		  <p class="content-text">
          The only drawback was that animated images are very large. My inital attempt was shot down by the mobile dev manager for size restraints, which started me down a long journey of learning about image compression. I was eventually able to decrease the size of the gifs enough to work with the constraints given by dev, and at that point interactivity was the name of the game. I asked dev to enhance the swiping, add a skip button, and add a swipe down to dismiss option.

    		    Delivery
       	  </h3>
    		  <p class="content-text">
    		  	I started this project understanding that sliding tutorial screens were not the optimal solution, and by the end the company was on board to get a third party onboarding solution. The company decided on Pendo, a company whose product would provide us with analytics as well as the ability to push messages in-app to our users. By utilizing Pendo, we could replace tutorial screens with in-app tooltip walkthroughs, and even segment those walkthroughs to have certain steps for certain users based on analytics. 
          </p>
          <p class="content-text">
          	Once we got access to Pendo, I designed all of the guide templates using HTML/CSS/JavaScript. I worked closely with our implementations team, teaching them how to use the templates I created in the Pendo Editor and creating special templates to fit their desires for help workflows. The content was mostly out of my hands at this point, but I remained a consultant of sorts for those on this project on the implementations side. 
          </p>
          <p class="content-text">
          	At this point in time, we have not yet committed to keeping Pendo based on unforseen complications, but we hope to continue to improve our onboarding process.
