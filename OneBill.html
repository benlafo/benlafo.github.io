    		The Problem

          <p class="content-text">
          	Our system is first and foremost a way for physicians to create charges for their patient encounters, but we have to different workflow options that have some similar and some different capabilities. We want to consolidate both workflows into one, merging all capabilities but reducing clutter. This project is such a large effort that we divided it into four major feature projects that could be delivered separately.

    		Discovery
       	  </h3>
          <p class="content-text">
          	Admittedly, my boss was given this project for the first two features and did most of the discovery research while I focused on other projects. However, I was given this project for features three and four (we are in the design phase for feature three, which we call E&M Handling). My discovery for this project has been mostly internal. Because this feature is about incorporating current functionality from one of our workflows into the new one (along with a few enhancements), my research has been largely working with the current version of our application. The areas that I have had to do outside research have been regarding best practices for handling workflows with multiple dialogs.

    		Design
       	  </h3>
          <p class="content-text">
          	Phase three of this project was originally my boss's, and as such I was given in-progress designs when the project transitioned to me. It was interesting working with her designs because I was not working with complete creative freedom. I had to work my ideas into a foundation that was already approved and somewhat developed. This isn't unlike most of my projects working with our current app, but normally when the current implementation hinders my design I get to change it. When I'm working with in-development design that hinders my project, I don't get to change it. 
          </p>
          <p class="content-text">
            The part of my boss's design that hindered mine was the fact that she made most of the workflow in a dialog box. There are several layers of hierarchy in this workflow, and to have only the second level in a dialog was a huge hindrance to displaying what were historically dialogs, since I know better than to display dialogs on top of dialogs. But that's what had to happen. We have a tool that helps our physicians calulate the correct service level, and they access that tool from the "Add Procedure" screen (the dialog in question). I chose to have this tool display as a dialog over the previous screen because of the amount of time spent on both of the dialogs. The two dialogs don't appear one after the other, and both are intentionally opened by the user.

    		Delivery

		      <p class="content-text">
		  	   This project is nearing development, but before then I need to conduct usability testing and heuristic evaluations. Product Management wants hard and fast numbers that prove to our clients that the new workflow will improve their physicians' performance. Everyone is a little antsy about such a big change to our main workflow, but I know the UX team will be able to provide proof of our design's efficiency by the end of the summer.
