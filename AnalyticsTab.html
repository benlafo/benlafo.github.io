          	Currently Ingenious Med provides two main sources of data analytics: Management Reports and our Analyze tool. The issue is that Analyze is only available to administrative users and management reports are cluttersome for admins and nearly nonexistent for physicians. We want to provide our users (primarily physicians) with easy to digest data about their performance so that we can drive increased productivity.

    		Discovery
       	  </h3>
          <p class="content-text">
          	Because physician users are our primary target with this project, I first gathered information about what physicians currently had access to and what they currently used most within that resource pool. I used that information to craft a rough sketch of a potential dashboard that could replace the tab in our application where those reports lived. I brought that rough sketch in front of seven users (a few physicians and a few admins) to get their feedback. I asked physicians if this is the information they would like to see, if this is a digestible way to receive that information, and several other questions. I asked the admin if this is the data that they want our app to draw their physicians' attention to and whether they thought visualizations would help at all. 
          </p>

            </div>
          </div>
          <p class="content-text">
            Gathering users for the research was the hardest part, but the information we received was invaluable. We learned that the data and visualizations would be worthless without some sort of comparative data or physician ranking system, as well as gathered a long list of desired metrics for the dashboard. I was positive at this point that we could build a much better and more valuable dashboard for our users. I wrote a report on this reserach and presented my findings to our internal stakeholders.

    		Design
       	  </h3>
          <p class="content-text">
          	I took these findings and began crafting a new dashboard, but along the way our company went through some restructuring and hiring, during which we received a new VP of product, product owner for analytics, and the project leader was taken off this project to focus on some other big ticket projects. These changes changed the focus of the dashboard. Now, it is more all encompassing with regards to data in our app. Product Management still wanted me to keep designing, but all the while they were changing the requirements. In the end, I was able to present a new design that included dashboards that are user-type specific, legacy management reports with a new UI, and our Analyze tool all in one place in our application that I called the "Analytics" tab. Mangement loved it!

            </div>
          </div>
          <p class="content-text">
            Soon after that, even the UX team went through changes, with my boss taking a position elsewhere and a new boss coming in. At this point, I began working closely with my new boss on this project, bouncing ideas around (it's always nice to get a fresh set of eyes), and that brings us to right now. I am currently designing this dashboard, but the strides we've made since the early stages are so monumental and such a great example of design process that I had to include it on this site.

    		Delivery
       	  </h3>
		      <p class="content-text">
		  	   Of course, since we're still in design, that means there has been no delivery to date, but development is scheduled for later this summer. I'm confident that we will have a design that our physician users will love, that is "future-proof" and can accommodate more metrics, more user types, and more analytics tools, and that is well received by our stakeholders.
